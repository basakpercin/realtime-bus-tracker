# Real Time Bus Tracker
### Real time bus tracker shows bus stops between MIT and Harvard using mapbox for map display and animates pins to show each bus stop at 1 second increments.
## How to Run and future improvements:
### Load the code on browser and click on 'show stops between MIT and Harvard' to start the animation and you should see the pin marker moving from one stop to another between MIT and Harvard.
### Future improvement includes changing map pin to a bus marker to create an animation of a bus moving from A to B.
